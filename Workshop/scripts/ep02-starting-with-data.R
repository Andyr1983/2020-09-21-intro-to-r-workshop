# Based on: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html

# Lets download some data (make sure the data folder exists)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")

# now we will read this "csv" into an R object called "surveys"
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")

# and  take a look at it


# BTW, we assumed our data was comma separated, however this might not
# always be the case. So we may been to tell read.csv more about our file.
help("read.csv")

# So what kind of an R object is "surveys" ?
